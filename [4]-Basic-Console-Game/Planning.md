## Design: Handling Host vs. Join (Server vs. Client Mode)

### Overview

To cleanly handle hosting (**server**) or joining (**client/player**) in your console game, you should encapsulate each role in its own class: `Server` and `Client`. The `main.cpp` menu selection will create and run these classes as needed, handling all respective logic (networking, game state, synchronization).

### Approach

- **When Hosting:**  
  - Create a `Server` object.
  - Server creates and manages a list of `Client` objects (players), handles connections, receives updates (e.g., movement), and sends world state to all clients.

- **When Joining:**  
  - Create a `Client` object.
  - Client connects to a server (by IP/host/port), sends updates, and receives the world state.

### Example Pseudocode

```cpp
// main.cpp
int main() {
  // ... (UI/menu code)
  if (userChoseHost) {
    Server server(/* config/port */);
    server.start();  // blocking: runs accept loop, game loop, etc.
  } else if (userChoseJoin) {
    Client client(/* server addr */);
    client.connect();
    client.run();    // Game loop: send input, receive state, draw UI
  }
}
```

### Class Sketch

#### server.h/server.cpp

```cpp
class Server {
public:
    Server(int port = DEFAULT_PORT);
    void start(); // Accepts clients, runs game loop

private:
    std::vector<Client> clients; // Connected clients
    void acceptClients();
    void updateClients();
    // Additional networking fields and methods
};
```

#### client.h/client.cpp

```cpp
class Client {
public:
    Client(const std::string& serverAddr, int port = DEFAULT_PORT);
    void connect();
    void run(); // Sends local input, receives world state

private:
    int id; // Unique client id assigned by server
    std::pair<int, int> position;
    // Additional networking fields and methods
};
```

### Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns:** Server and client logic are isolated in their own classes.  
- **Scalability:** Handling multiple clients is easy in server class via the clients container.  
- **Maintainability:** Modular, extensible for features like chat, authentication, etc.

**Summary Table**

| Menu Option | You create             | Core Loop             | Responsibilities                     |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Host        | `Server` object       | server.start()        | Accept clients, sync game state      |
| Join        | `Client` object       | client.connect/run()  | Send input, receive game/world state |

**TIP:**  
If desired, you can make a base `INetworkRole` interface (pure virtual) to allow for polymorphism, but for simple games, two separate classes (Server, Client) work great!



Using server.cpp, client.cpp and main.cpp of Basic Console Game, what would be the best method of handling when you choose to host or play? 

I was thinking on making server and client classes, so when you chose to host it creates a server object that will be managing the code, and if you chose to play it will create an object of client that will connect to the client

For example, if you host, it will create an object server, that will have a list of clients (of the class client), to manage the multiple clients connected, get their updates, and update them the position of the rest of the players and that
